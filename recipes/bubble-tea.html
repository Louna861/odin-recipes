    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Bubble Tea, also known as boba tea, is a popular Taiwanese drink that has gained worldwide recognition. It consists of a tea base, often black or green tea, mixed with milk or fruit flavors and sweetened with syrup or sugar. The drink is then shaken or blended with ice, giving it a refreshing and smooth texture. What makes bubble tea unique is the addition of chewy tapioca pearls (boba) or other toppings such as fruit jelly, pudding, or aloe vera.</p>
