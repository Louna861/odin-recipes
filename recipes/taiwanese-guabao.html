    <H2>Description</H2>
    <p> Guabao, often referred to as the "Taiwanese hamburger," is a popular street food in Taiwan. It consists of a soft, fluffy steamed bun filled with braised pork belly, pickled mustard greens, crushed peanuts, and fresh cilantro. The combination of tender, flavorful pork with the crunch of peanuts and the tangy bite of pickled greens creates a perfect balance of taste and texture. This dish is commonly enjoyed as a snack or a quick meal and is a favorite during Lunar New Year celebrations and night market visits.</p>
